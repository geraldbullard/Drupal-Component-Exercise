Since it has been more than a couple years since I even looked at Drupal, I basically started from scratch with Drupal 9. I think Drupal 7 was the versionof the site I was asked to simply debug errors on and get running again back then. There was no real use/editing/customizing at all.

I did some research on drupal 9 documentation and some searching to find a means to create what was asked for in the Test PDF. I found several pages and finally a decent YouTube Tutorial on what I was creating using the Paragraphs module.

I have documented my efforts ion this text file and in my repo as asked to give a detailed account of what I went thur to achieve this result.

TUTORIAL TO HELP ME: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSdIX-i394U

====================================================================
(3hrs)
 - Setup Site in WAMP.
 - Ran web based (localhost) installer.
 - Configured site as Demo Food Site for content.
 - Paragraphs installation via download and composer command.
 - Started Setup of Field Types for new Profiles Component.
 - Had to disable the PHP Xdebug zend extention and raise the memory allowance to 256. Still errors.
 - Media Item was removed and no errors. Moving On.
 - Allow view profile block content in Paragraph permissions to view by anonymous visitors.
 - Way too much debug during all this.
 - Continuing to watch tuts and try to get to the part where I can actually code custom component code to make the page content react as it needs to. Looking like I will need to re-install Drupal and start over as my drush commands are generating a.launcher file now. Ugh.

====================================================================
(1.5hrs)
 - RESTART
 - Installed Drupal 9 via composer.
 - After geting things back to par with Paragraph Types and Content Types I get Fatal Error trying to create sub theme from radix....
   - Fatal error: Uncaught Error: Class 'Drush\Config\Environment' not found in H:\ELYK\www\drupal\vendor\drush\drush\drush.php:62
   - During comapnd for drush en components. Ugh.
